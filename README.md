# Swiggy-SQL
This project focuses on analyzing Swiggy's sales data using SQL to extract insights related to customers, restaurants, and delivery partners. The goal is to understand key business metrics, such as customer engagement, restaurant performance, and delivery partner efficiency, to help Swiggy make data-driven decisions.

Project Overview
In this project, I used SQL queries to perform various analyses on the Swiggy dataset. The project involves querying customer data, restaurant reviews and revenue, and delivery partner activity. Key findings include customer order trends, top-rated restaurants, and delivery partner efficiency.

SQL Queries Used
-- 1. Display all customers who live in 'Delhi'.
SELECT customer_id, name, city FROM customers WHERE city = 'Delhi';

-- 2. Find the average rating of all restaurants in 'Mumbai'.
SELECT ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS Average FROM restaurants WHERE city = 'Mumbai';

-- 3. List all customers who have placed at least one order.
SELECT DISTINCT customers.customer_id, customers.name FROM customers INNER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;

-- 4. Display the total number of orders placed by each customer.
SELECT customers.customer_id,customers.name, COUNT(orders.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
GROUP BY customers.customer_id, customers.name;

-- 5. Find the total revenue generated by each restaurant.
SELECT restaurants.restaurant_id, restaurants.name, COALESCE(SUM(orders.total_amount), 0) AS revenue
FROM restaurants
LEFT JOIN orders ON orders.restaurant_id = restaurants.restaurant_id
GROUP BY restaurants.restaurant_id, restaurants.name;

-- 6. Find the top 5 restaurants with the highest average rating.
SELECT restaurant_id, name, AVG(rating) AS avg_rating FROM restaurants GROUP BY restaurant_id, name ORDER BY avg_rating DESC LIMIT 5;

-- 7. Display all customers who have never placed an order.
SELECT customers.customer_id, customers.name FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
WHERE orders.customer_id IS NULL;

-- 8. Find the number of orders placed by each customer in 'Mumbai'.
SELECT customers.customer_id, customers.name, COUNT(orders.order_id) AS no_of_orders
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
WHERE customers.city = 'Mumbai'
GROUP BY customers.name, customers.customer_id;

-- 9. Display all orders placed in the last 30 days.
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;

-- 10. List all delivery partners who have completed more than 1 delivery.
SELECT deliverypartners.partner_id, deliverypartners.name, COUNT(deliveryupdates.order_id) 
FROM deliverypartners
JOIN orderdelivery ON deliverypartners.partner_id = orderdelivery.partner_id
JOIN deliveryupdates ON orderdelivery.order_delivery_id = deliveryupdates.delivery_id
WHERE deliveryupdates.status = 'Delivered'
GROUP BY deliverypartners.partner_id, deliverypartners.name;

-- 11. Find the customers who have placed orders on exactly three different days.
SELECT customers.customer_id, customers.name, COUNT(orders.order_date) FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
GROUP BY customers.customer_id, customers.name HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_date) = 3;

-- 12. Find the delivery partner who has worked with the most different customers.
SELECT deliverypartners.partner_id, deliverypartners.name, COUNT(DISTINCT orders.customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM deliverypartners
JOIN orderdelivery ON deliverypartners.partner_id = orderdelivery.partner_id
JOIN orders ON orderdelivery.order_id = orders.order_id
GROUP BY deliverypartners.partner_id, deliverypartners.name
ORDER BY customer_count DESC LIMIT 1;

-- 13. Identify customers who have the same city and have placed orders at the same restaurants, but on different dates.
SELECT DISTINCT c1.name AS customer1, c2.name AS customer2, c1.city, o1.restaurant_id,
r.name, DATE(o1.order_date) AS order_date1, DATE(o2.order_date) AS order_date2
FROM Customers c1
JOIN Orders o1 ON c1.customer_id = o1.customer_id
JOIN customers c2 ON c1.city = c2.city
JOIN orders o2 ON c2.customer_id = o2.customer_id
JOIN restaurants r ON r.restaurant_id = o1.restaurant_id 
WHERE o1.restaurant_id = o2.restaurant_id
AND DATE(o1.order_date) <>  DATE(o2.order_date)
AND c1.customer_id <> c2.customer_id
ORDER BY c1.city, o1.restaurant_id, order_date1;
